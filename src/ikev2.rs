/// prepended four octets of zeros.  These four octets of zeros are not
/// part of the IKE message and are not included in any of the length
/// fields or checksums defined by IKE.  Each IKE message begins with the
/// IKE header, denoted HDR in this document.  Following the header are
/// one or more IKE payloads each identified by a Next Payload field in
/// the preceding payload.  Payloads are identified in the order in which
/// they appear in an IKE message by looking in the Next Payload field in
/// the IKE header, and subsequently according to the Next Payload field
/// in the IKE payload itself until a Next Payload field of zero
/// indicates that no payloads follow.  If a payload of type "Encrypted"
